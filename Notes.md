### Notes:
* Potentially use external data such as income, C02 emissions etc.
* Look at categories with low variation between months
* Imputation is a very common way of dealing with item nonresponse, and many ATUS variables are imputed if missing (please refer to the ATUS data dictionaries at https://www.bls.gov/tus/dictionaries.htm for further information on how to identify edited variables and their allocated values).
* Take into account missing data encoded as 0s.
